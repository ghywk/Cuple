## Description
As you can see, this is a Minecraft Hacked Client from Minecraft Java Edition version 1.21.1. 

It works on the Fabric mod loader, i.e. Fabric API and Fabric Loader.

## Advantage
Unlike Liquidbounce, this client **does not use Kotlin language**, so your compilation will be simpler and you **will not need Fabric language kotlin API support** while playing!

>List : 
>1. Most complete foundational systems, highly liberalized
>2. Minimizing redundant code
>3. ~~In my personal opinion~~, the best code
>4. Good **furry** client

## How to use
My first time using GitHub, I can only suggest that you download the zip file and build it LOL.
